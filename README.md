# APLICACIÃ“N WEB: GUESS YOUR NUMBER!

## This is my first try with JavaScript, and i want to be funny!

Choose a random number and guess my number!
Select a number with an input, and push the button.
JavaScript starts to think!
With a getRandom function, Java selects a number, less than 100.
Then a initial conditional function starts to work, and give you differents
answers with some clues....and makes the magic!
But if you are a clumsy (like me) you need a lot of tries!
So i put a counter function, to show your brightness!
